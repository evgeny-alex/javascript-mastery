      JavaScript is the language that brings the web to life.
      It allows websites to react to user actions, update content dynamically,
      and communicate with servers in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today JavaScript runs not only in the browser, but also on servers,
      mobile apps, desktop apps, and even IoT devices.
      If you want to build modern web applications — JavaScript is essential.
    </p>

    <h3>Where JavaScript runs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Browser</strong> — adds interactivity to websites</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js</strong> — allows JavaScript to run on the server</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quick example</h3>
    <p>
      The simplest JavaScript program looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>console.log("Hello, JavaScript");</code></pre>

    <p>
      This line prints text to the console and is often the first thing developers try
      when learning JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3>JavaScript ecosystem</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Frameworks and libraries (React, Vue, etc.)</li>
      <li>Package managers (npm)</li>
      <li>Tools for building, testing, and deploying apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How this course works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Short lessons focused on one concept at a time</li>
      <li>Hands-on examples and real code</li>
      <li>Practice tasks to reinforce learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By the end of this course, you will understand JavaScript fundamentals
      and be ready to build real applications.
